# **rapp2**

Windows tray utility for quick start of recently used applications.

It adds menu to task tray with apps list and fills it with new started apps. User can click on app name and it will be started immediately.

The main difference with it's predcessor [**rapp**](https://github.com/crocla/rapp) is monitoring only the apps with visible windows.
